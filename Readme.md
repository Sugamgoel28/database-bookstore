# Bookstore Database Schema

Welcome to the database schema documentation for the Bookstore project. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the database schema designed as part of the blinkit SDE intern application process.

The schema is carefully crafted to facilitate the management of various aspects of a bookstore, including books, authors, publishers, customers, orders, payments, coupons, and reviews. Each table is meticulously designed to capture relevant information and establish relationships between entities, enabling efficient data management and retrieval.

Additionally, this repository includes SQL queries tailored to the specific requirements of the Bookstore project. These queries are designed to retrieve vital information such as top-selling books and total sales revenue within a specified period.

Whether you're exploring the schema for understanding, implementing it in your project, or evaluating it for potential improvements, this documentation serves as a valuable resource to navigate the intricacies of the Bookstore database schema.

## Queries

### Query 1: Retrieve Top-Selling Books

This query retrieves the top-selling books for the period from January 1, 2024, to January 31, 2024. It returns the ISBN, title, and total quantity sold for each book, ordered by total sold in descending order.

```sql
SELECT 
    b.isbn, 
    b.book_title, 
    SUM(oi.quantity) AS total_sold
FROM 
    order_item oi
JOIN 
    book b ON oi.book_id = b.isbn
JOIN 
    "order" o ON oi.order_id = o.id
WHERE 
    o.order_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-01-31' 
    -- It can be replaced with the desired range of dates
GROUP BY 
    b.isbn, 
    b.book_title
ORDER BY 
    total_sold DESC;
-- LIMIT A; We can adjust the limit to get top A selling books. Ex: LIMIT 3 will give top 3 selling books
```

### Query 2: Calculate Total Sales Revenue

This query calculates the total sales revenue for the period from January 1, 2024, to January 31, 2024. It sums the total revenue generated from book sales within the specified period.

SELECT 
    SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) AS total_revenue
FROM 
    order_item oi
JOIN 
    "order" o ON oi.order_id = o.id
WHERE 
    o.order_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-01-31'; 
    -- It can be replaced with the desired range of dates
```
